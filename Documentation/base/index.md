 # Introduction

## What does it do

The “Documentation” TYPO3 extension is designed to create and maintain project documentation directly within your TYPO3 instance. Documentation is accessible via the Help module, making it easy for teams to quickly understand how the system is used.

- **Suitable for both administrators and CMS editors**
- **Easy to use and understand for editors**
- **Supports exporting documentation as a PDF document**

This helps onboard users faster, centralize project knowledge, and keep guidance close to where people work.

## Contribution

Contributions are vital to open-source success and are not limited to code. Please prioritize meaningful improvements without complicating the user experience.

### Contribution workflow

1. Open a GitHub issue prior to any development to align on the goal, scope, and acceptance criteria.
2. For bug fixes, include a description and reproducible steps. Only reproducible issues will be addressed.
3. For features, assess broad user value and avoid unnecessary complexity. A prior discussion in an issue is required before submitting a pull request.
4. Submit pull requests against the up-to-date release branch.
